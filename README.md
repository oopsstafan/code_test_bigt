## Introduction
This is a small weather info application created by React.js. Datasource was priorly given, all required weather info is shown and here is a forecast visualization on the webpage.


## Assumptions
1. All information is shown on one single page (I assume there is no need to have more than 1 page for required info)
2. I convert the given json file to js file for easy importing into the module. The js file is in weatherinfo folder.


## Resources
1. React.js (staging tool is 'create-react-app')
2. antd(UI component library for responsive and delicate design)
3. echarts and echarts-for-react(These are for data visualization)



## Thank you for your opportunity! and this is my test on git!!
